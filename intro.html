    Sania’s post featured her son Izhaan’s pic but she did not add any photo of her husband Shoaib Malik. Netizens are wondering if Sania just indirectly confirmed her divorce.
    One social media user wrote, “More strength to you, Alhamdulillah for 2022 #levitating Calendar!”. Another wrote, “True icon and fighter in every sense…deepest respect..”
    Several fans requested her to issue a clear statement about her marital status. One user wrote, “Start the New Year 2023 on a positive note by scotching rumours doing rounds in the media of your imminent divorce with Shoaib. At least for your son, you should think twice even if you have anything on your mind!”
